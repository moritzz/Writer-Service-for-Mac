Hi

This is a simple system wide service to add a global "Edit in Writer" action and/or shortcut to your Mac OS X installation. To install:

1. Copy "Edit in Writer.workflow" to "~/Library/Services".
2. Make sure "Enable access for assistive devices" in the Universal Access preference pane is ticked.

There's now a "Edit in Writer" command in the "Services" menu in every app's menu. To define a shortcut for that: 

1. Open the Keyboard preference pane.
2. Switch to the "Keyboard Shortcuts" tab.
3. Choose "Services" in the left pane.
4. Scroll down to the section "General" in the right pane.
5. Double click on the right side of the "Edit in Writer" entry.
6. Hit the shortcut you want use. (cmd-alt-E works just fine for most apps.)

Enjoy.

Cheers,
Moritz
