Hi

These are two simple system wide services to add global actions and/or shortcuts to your Mac OS X installation to edit the current text from any application in iA Writer.

* Both actions __do not__ work if Writer is __in full screen mode.__ 
* The "Edit Selection in Writer" only works, if some text is selected, but is faster and __much more insensitive__ to the source application's capabilities.

# Installation Instructions

1. Copy "Edit in Writer.workflow" and/or "Edit Selection in Writer.workflow" to "~/Library/Services".
2. Make sure "Enable access for assistive devices" in the Universal Access preference pane is ticked.

There's now a "Edit in Writer" and/or "Edit Selection in Writer" command in the "Services" menu of every app. To define a shortcut for that: 

1. Click on any app's menu (let's say "Finder" right to the Apple).
2. Choose "Service Preferences..." from the "Services" Menu.
3. Scroll to the section "General" and/or "Text" in the right pane.
4. Double click on the right side of the "Edit in Writer" or "Edit Selection in Writer" entry.
5. Hit the shortcut you want use. (cmd-alt-E works just fine for most apps.)
6. Close "System Preferences".
7. Check the menu "Services" again to verify the shortcuts. (This seams to be necessary to reload menu shortcuts.)

Enjoy.

Cheers,
Moritz
